Enriched classes among exchanged metabolites for phyla observed in Bulgarelli dataset

The third neighborhood of metabolite terms was removed from the universal set.
The second neighborhood of the root was removed from the universal set.

For each metabolite ontology term, a one-sided Fisher test for the upper tail was performed.

All p-values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (initial alpha = 0.05).
