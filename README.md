# Community-based gap-filling of microbial communities sampled from _Arabidopsis thalina_ soil, root, and leaf 

## Description
This repository contains all files used for iterative gap-filling and subsequent analysis
of 432 consensus genome-scale metabolic models for OTUs sampled from _A. thaliana_ roots, leaves and surrounding soil.
The consensus models were generated by merging draft models from four different approaches:
- KBase (Arkin et al. 2018)
- RAVEN 2.0 (Wang et al. 2018)
- CarveMe (Machado et al. 2018)
- AuReMe (Aite et al. 2018)

## Reference


## Requirements
- Matlab (tested with version R2017b)
- CPLEX solver
- R packages:
